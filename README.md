# OrangeHRM_Project
The OrangeHRM project for QA automation testing focuses on ensuring the functionality and reliability of the OrangeHRM web application, a widely used open-source human resource management system. This project employs a robust automation framework built primarily using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG, facilitating comprehensive end-to-end UI testing.

Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to automate various user interface tests on the OrangeHRM platform. By leveraging automation, the project aims to enhance testing efficiency, reduce manual effort, and ensure that critical functionalities perform as expected.

Key Features
End-to-End Testing: The framework covers a wide range of functionalities within the OrangeHRM application, including user login, employee management, and reporting features.
Selenium WebDriver: Utilized for interacting with web elements, allowing for automated execution of user actions on the application.
TestNG Framework: Employed for organizing test cases effectively, providing powerful annotations, and generating detailed reports.
Extent Reports Integration: This feature allows for the generation of visually appealing and comprehensive test execution reports, aiding in better analysis of test outcomes.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java
Automation Tools: Selenium WebDriver, TestNG
Reporting Tools: Extent Reports
Build Tools: Apache Maven

Testing Scenarios
The project includes various testing scenarios such as:
Logging into the OrangeHRM demo site.
Creating and managing employee records.
Conducting searches within the PIM (Personnel Information Management) dashboard.
Validating updates to employee information.
Performing logout operations and verifying session management.
Execution and Reporting
Tests can be executed using Maven or Gradle commands, which compile test classes and run the defined test suites. After execution, detailed reports are generated that include information about passed/failed tests and any screenshots captured during testing.
This automation project not only streamlines the testing process but also contributes to maintaining high software quality by enabling early detection of defects before production deployment.
